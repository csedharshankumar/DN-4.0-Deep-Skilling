# Cognizant - DN 4.0 Deep Skilling 🚀

This is my personal repository to track progress and upload solutions as I work through the **Cognizant DN 4.0 Deep Skilling Program**. Right now it's a blank slate — but not for long!

## 📦 What's Coming Soon

- ✅ DSA solutions in Python (Binary Trees, Graphs, Recursion, and more)
- 🔧 Debugging walkthroughs and clean code practices
- ✍️ Notes, strategies, and annotated explanations for trickier problems

## 📌 Why this repo?

This is my digital notebook — a space where I'll be:
- Practicing concepts covered in the course
- Uploading solutions at my own pace
- Reflecting and learning as I go

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- Git & GitHub
- IDE of choice: VS Code / Jupyter (flexible!)

🔧 _Still under development — more folders and content will appear soon as I continue learning._
